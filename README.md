# YOLO-OpenCV
Apply pre-trained (COCO data set) YOLO model on images and videos


1.) Have OpenCV v4.0.0 installed 
2.) YOLO is the top directory. 
3.) Directories images,output,videos and yolo-coco must be in the YOLO directory
4.) ImageSTartupScript.py runs a script to identify objects in an image
5.) VideoSTartupScript.py runs a script to indentify objects in a video
6.) The file yolov3.weights in YOLO/yolo-coco was too large to store in GitHub so I included a URL to Google Drive so it can be downloaded.
